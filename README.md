## Overview


This challenge was a little complex, due to the fact that I was in doubt about using some tags and css properties, but other than that the challenge was very easy.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

At the beginning of the challenge I created the html structure, first I inserted the main tag, then the section tag which will be where the content will be, then I added the div tag in each minisections in the main section. I added h2, h3, h4 and p in each required div.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I had a little difficulty in certain decisions of tags and css properties, I think that after solving this challenge I was able to better learn some properties of flex.

### Continued development

I want to improve my knowledge in flexbox and grid, know how to use them better.
